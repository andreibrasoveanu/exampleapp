# Cloud Elements Example App

An example app to get started using the Cloud Elements platform.

## Overview
This is a frontend application written in React that demonstrates the use of Cloud Elements APIs. The application is set up as a tutorial that walks you through the code needed to:
1. Authenticate to a 3rd party application
2. Create an "authenticated instance" with Cloud Elements
3. Use the corresponding "instance token" to retrieve 3rd party data

## Installation
If you don't have `node` and `npm` installed, do [that](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/installing-node) first.

Clone or download the project.

Navigate to you placed the project folder:
```bash
# Clone repository:
$ cd exampleapp

# Install all necessary npm packages:
$ npm install
```
And that's it!

## Use

Run the application:

```bash
# Start Project
$ npm start
```
After the project compiles, your default web browswer will be opened to http://localhost:3000 where you can view the application. You should see a screen like this:

You will also notice in your terminal an ngrok.io link has been exposed. This link is generated by default when the server is started, it is then used as a redirect link for your 3rd party application authentication process as indicated in the homepage of the exampleapp. If you'd rather use a persistent ngrok link, you can modify those settings in the `/scripts/start.js` file.

From here just walk through the steps in the exampleapp homepage. When steps have been completed, green checks will appear.
